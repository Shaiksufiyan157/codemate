DSA preparation is not about solving problems once.  
It’s about remembering them when it matters — in interviews.

Most developers solve dozens or hundreds of DSA problems, but:

- Forget the approach after a few weeks  
- Don’t have time to re-code everything before interviews  
- Skip note-making because it’s slow and boring  

**Codemate exists to fix that.**

---

## 📌 What Problem Does Codemate Solve?

❌ Re-coding 200 problems before an interview is impossible  
❌ Reading full solutions doesn’t build recall  
❌ Manual DSA notes break consistency  

✅ Codemate turns your solved problems into **1-minute revision cards**  
✅ So you revise thinking, not typing  
✅ And walk into interviews with confidence  

---

## 🧠 How Codemate Works (Real Workflow)

1. Solve a DSA problem on LeetCode / GFG / Codeforces  
2. Paste:
   - Your solution code  
   - The problem link  

3. Codemate automatically generates:
   - Approach (concise & interview-ready)  
   - Data structures & algorithms used  
   - Time & space complexity  

4. Save it into your personal **Problems Bank**  
5. Revise later in **Rapid Fire Mode** — no code shown  

⏱️ ~60 seconds per problem  
📚 Revise 100+ problems without burnout  

---

## ⚡ Why Codemate Is Different

Unlike traditional DSA trackers or notes apps:

- You don’t write explanations  
- You don’t tag problems manually  
- You don’t calculate complexities  

👉 You just paste your code and link  
👉 Codemate handles the rest  

This keeps you consistent — even on busy days.

## 🔥 Rapid Fire Mode (Core Differentiator)

Built for last-minute interview revision:

- Flashcard-style problem review  
- Tests problem logic without showing code  
- Forces recall instead of passive reading  
- Perfect for interview week  

This is where problems get cemented in memory.

## 🤖 AI-Powered, But Purpose-Driven

Codemate uses Generative AI only where it adds real value.

### AI Workflow

**Input**
- Raw solution code (C / C++ / Java / Python / JavaScript)  
- Problem URL  

**Processing**
- Streams data to OpenRouter  
- Uses Nvidia Nemotron-3 for structured extraction  
- Strict validation to reject invalid inputs  

**AI Generates**
- 📌 Problem title  
- 🧠 Approach summary (compressed, interview-ready)  
- ⏱️ Time complexity  
- 💾 Space complexity  
- 🏷️ DSA & algorithm tags  

AI stays invisible.  
Your recall stays sharp.
